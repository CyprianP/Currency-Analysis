# Currency-Analysis

This project provides a Python script for analyzing currency exchange rates. The script uses data from the European Central Bank and performs various statistical analyses, including regression analysis and efficiency tests. The resulting visualizations can help users understand trends in currency exchange rates.

To use the script, users will need to have Python installed on their computer and run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or other Python environment. The script requires several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and matplotlib.

The project also includes a sample dataset of Eurozone currency exchange rates that can be used to test the script. Users can modify the code to analyze other datasets or add additional variables to the regression model.

Overall, this project is a useful tool for anyone interested in analyzing currency exchange rates using Python.
